== Special Comments for R projects or other script-based analysis ==

Usually one file for data cleaning, saving a cleaned dataset!

Suggestion: one graphic or output --> 1 R file (ideally)

Example

cleaning.r -> reads in your raw data and saves a cleaned version of the data

analysis1.r  -> do statistical analysis - write output to output folder / potentially call helper functions
analysis2.r

fig1.r         -> do figures - write output to output folder / potentially call helper functions
fig2.r

helpfunctions1.r
helpfunctions2.r
