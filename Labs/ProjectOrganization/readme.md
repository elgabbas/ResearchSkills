# Project organization

Keeping your project structured (also on your computer) will simplify your work greatly. A few things that are recommended:

* Keep everything in one main folder!
* Separate subfolders for data, analysis, outcomes / result and writing
* Keep all paths in scripts, R, LaTeX relativ (as in ../data/datafile.RData)
* Ideally, you would then put the whole folder under [version control](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/tree/master/Labs/VersionControl) (it's not neccessary for this course, )

## Template

* [Here](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/tree/master/Labs/ProjectOrganization/ExampleProject) we provide an exemplary folder structure with some simulated data, basic analysis and plotting, and the implementation of these results in a LaTeX document. Note the comments in the folders
* For your project, please use the same structure. You can download a zipped version of the project template, including the hints and templates for R and LaTeX [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/raw/master/Labs/ProjectOrganization/ExampleProject.zip).
