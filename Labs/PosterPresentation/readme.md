# Poster 

A large-format poster is featuring a short title, an introduction to your burning question, an overview of your novel experimental approach, your amazing results in graphical form, some insightful discussion of aforementioned results, a listing of previously published articles that are important to your research, and some brief acknowledgement of the tremendous assistance and financial support conned from others â€” if all text is kept to a minimum, a person could fully read your poster in 5-10 minutes (really).
