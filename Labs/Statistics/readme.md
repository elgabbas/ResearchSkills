# Data visualization and analysis with R

R is the de-facto standard for statistical analysis ecology and beyond. There is no getting around learning R if you want to analyze data. The following resources are meant to help you getting a good start:

#### Lecture notes

* The **[RS statistics lecture notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s38ge7pjgf55qs1/EssentialStatistics.pdf?dl=0)** provides an introduction to the topics of statistics and data analysis


#### Practicals

* [Graphics with R](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/blob/master/Labs/Statistics/Practicals/GraphicsInR/Rgraphics.md)

* [Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/blob/master/Labs/Statistics/Practicals/StatisticalAnalysisInR/Statistics.md)

For the course, I will make zipped versions of this practicals, together with source code, data and scripts, avaiable on ILIAS.

#### Software to install

If you want to run / try out the code, you need to install:
