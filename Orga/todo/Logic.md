## Explanation of logical fallacies

# blogs and non-scientific literature:

- Very condensed general information about logical fallacies with a few examples clarifying the matter. 
http://www.logicalfallacies.info/

-  Comprehensive list of information and examples of logical fallacies by Dr. Michael C. Labossiere, the author of a Macintosh tutorial named Fallacy Tutorial Pro 3.0.

- Blog by a biologist (PhD) who wants to stay anonymous. Mostly opionion based. See controverial comments. 
	However, convincingly well strutured in 7 entries about logic. Additionally, website provides generals information on logic in science.

# Scientif literature:

- Rather applied example and not based on the common fallacies. However, or maybe particularly interesting for the RS audience. 
Article tackles problems with logic within the experimental design, not only during the write up. Covers broadly statistical logic.

- Gerneral covering of informal logic + historic background:

- What are logical fallacies. Mainly discussing formal logic and the two most common fallacies: denying the antecedent, affirming the consequent

- Guide to logical fallacies. Examples of Don'ts and how to prevent them.

- There are many more abstracts of which very few are actually accessible.

## Comment:
I would not start a new lab in this course. It is definitely an interesting subject and noteworthy, but I find that teaching logic is beyond the scope of this class. 
Though, we may recommend to read about logic in science and provide some links to literature.
